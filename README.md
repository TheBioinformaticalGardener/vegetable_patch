# vegetable_patch
A vegetable patch is a part of the garden where you may find edible plants that are meant to grow throughout the season and hopefully provide some harvest that will sustain you during the dark months. However, there are usually many pitfalls before the patch provide any vegetables that are ready to be harvested. The gardener may for instance forget to water certain areas or weeds can invade the space. Moreover, it is somewhat unlikely that all vegetables are ready at the same time. 

Like a true vegetable patch and its produce, this directory contain code that are under active development in various stages. The code is meant to be useful for several projects that I am working on.
